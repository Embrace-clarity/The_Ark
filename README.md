# Â¿Democracy's Favorite Device?

The Ark is a portable computer we're developing to make it simple to participate in a Democracy. 
  It works similar to a smartphone and you can build it yourself. You can also upgrade, mod, or repair it however you please since it uses open-source software and all the components to build one are available to buy.


 If you want to be involved please [submit an idea\issue](https://github.com/thearkadia/The_Ark/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/thearkadia/The_Ark/pulls).
