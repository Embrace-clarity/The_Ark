# Democracy's Favorite Device

 The Ark is a portable computer we're developing to make it simple to participate in a Democracy. 
 It works similar to a smart phone but can also be modded or upgraded and runs GNU/Linux.
 
Currently looking for more software developers and we're willing to ship prototypes to developers. If you want to be involved submit an issue or pull request.

Currently powered by the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 Lite and The Ark PCB.
