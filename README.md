# Â¿Democracy's Favorite Device?

The Ark is a portable computer we're developing to make it simple to participate in a Democracy. It is (powered by the [Raspberry Pi Compute Module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-3-lite/)) runs a modified version of Raspbian OS and a forked version of Pocket-Home for the mobile UI.

To simplify participating in a Democracy we will include open source applications that allow citizens to easily track the voting history of their representative. An application for citizens to simplify the process of boycotting companies they don't want to support by easily finding what products the company owns or has a stake in and be able to easily find alternatives to the product\service they are looking to purchase. An application for journalists to publish articles on a peer to peer network making it very hard to be censored. An application for journalists and charities to easily recieve direct donations from supporters similar to Patreon. (images below are mockups of the applications we will develop. No companies, charities, or journalists will be in the boycott/support list by default) 

You can upgrade, mod, or repair it however you please since it uses open-source software and the pcb files are available.
