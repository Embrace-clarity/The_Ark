# Â¿Democracy's Favorite Device?

The Ark is a portable computer we're developing to make it simple to participate in a Democracy. 
 You can also upgrade, mod, or repair it however you please since it uses open-source software and all the components to build one are available.


 If you want to be involved  submit an [idea\issue](https://github.com/thearkadia/The_Ark/issues), a [pull request](https://github.com/thearkadia/The_Ark/pulls), or [sign up for the newsletter](https://thearkadia.com/pages/newsletter).
