# Â¿Democracy's Favorite Device?

The Ark is a portable computer we're developing to make it simple to participate in a Democracy. 
 It works similar to a smart phone but can also be repaired, and/or upgraded.


 If you want to be involved please [submit an idea\issue](https://github.com/thearkadia/The_Ark/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/thearkadia/The_Ark/pulls).

Currently powered by the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 Lite and The Ark PCB running a modified Raspbian image.
